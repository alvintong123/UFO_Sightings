# UFO_Sightings
## Overview 
The purpose of this challenge was to create a website where we are able to display UFO data from our data.js file in a more readable manner. On top of that the website was created to be visially pleasing with an interesting hook paragraph along with a well organized data table to display all of our data. We also were able to add multiple filter options that would showcase only the data values that matched the desired criteria allowing user control and customization. 
## Results 
This webpage has multiple search criteria that allows the user to refine their search. Our search criteria is split into 5 sections: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. When inputting search criteria users must use all lowercase and exact spelling to ensure that values will be displayed.

In the image above, we can see the filters at work. The State and Country are filled out with "ca" and "us" respectively and our data table is filtered with the desired criteria.

In this image above we have further refined the search and we can see there is less data than before, however it is very specific. 
## Summary  
### Drawback
One major drawback is that there is no loose matching and only exact criteria must be used. This means that if we wanted to find the City "bonita" we have to type exactly like that excluding variations like "Bonita".  
### Recommendations 
One recommendation I have that would make the website better would add more images to make the website look for appealing. Adding some images of aliens or possibly links to articles about UFOs would be interesting. My second recommendation to make the website more fun would be adding something like a real-time UFO sighting box that will refresh every 5 to 10 minutes to update users about the latest UFO sightings. This could be accomplished by using web-scraping techniques to look at other websites to display their sightings while also providing a link and credit to their websites.
